# Rock-Paper-Scissors-
Js project for Odin project

For this project I have to:

- Make the player input one of the three options: Rock Paper Scissors;
- Make the game chose randomly one of the three options too;
- Give a response according to the win/loss of the player;

(optional)
- Add a win/loss count;
- Add a bo3/bo5 system;
- Add an interface;
- Add a button for each choice so the player doesn't need to type;
